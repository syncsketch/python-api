Description: # Syncsketch Python API
        This package provides methods to communicate with the syncsketch servers and wraps CRUD (create, reade, update, delete) methods to interact with Reviews.
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        
        #### Installation
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/syncsketch/python-api.git
        
        
        #### Compatibility
        This library was tested with and confirmed on python versions:
        - 2.7.14+
        - 3.6
        - 3.8
        
        ### Basic Examples
        
        
        #### Authentication
        Before we can start working, we need to get an `API_KEY` which you can obtain from the syncsketch [settings page](https://syncsketch.com/pro/#userProfile/settingsTab). Follow the given link, login and scroll down to the bottom headline `Developer Options` to see your 40 character API-Key.
        
        
        Setting up a connection with your SyncSketch projects is as easy as following. 
        
            from syncsketch import SyncSketchAPI
            
            username = "username"
            api_key = "api-key-123"
            
            s = SyncSketchAPI(username, api_key)
            
            s.is_connected()
        
        If you got a `200` response, you successfully connected to the syncsketch server! You can proceed with the next examples. We will skip the setup code for the next examples and the snippets will rely on each other, so make sure you run them one by one.
        
        
        ##### 1) Choose your account
        
        Before we can create/read/update/delete reviews, we need to select an account
        
            accounts = s.get_accounts()
            first_account = accounts["objects"][0]
        
        ##### 2) Create a project
        
        Let's create a project with the selected account
        
            project = s.create_project(first_account["id"], 'DEV Example Project', 'DEV API Testing')
        
        This creates a new Project called `Dev Example Project` with the description `DEV API Testing`
        
        
        ##### 3) Create a review
        
        We can now add a Review to our newly created Project using it's `id`
        
            review = s.create_review(project['id'], 'DEV Review (api)','DEV Syncsketch API Testing')
        
        
        ##### 4) Get list of reviews
        
        
            print(s.get_reviews_by_project_id(project['id'])
        
        
        ##### 5) Upload a review item
        
        You can upload a file to the created review with the review id, we provided one example file in this repo under `examples/test.webm` for testing.
        
            item_data = s.add_media(review['id'],'examples/test.webm')
        
        
        If all steps were successful, you should see the following in the web-app.

        ### Additional Examples
        
        ##### Adding a user to the project
            addedUsers = s.add_users_to_project(
                project_id,
                [{'email':'test@syncsketch.com','permission':'viewer'}],
                "This is a note to include with the welcome email"
            )
            print(addedUsers)
        
        
        ##### Traverse all Reviews
            projects = s.get_projects()
            
            for project in projects['objects']:
                print(project)
        
        
        ##### Traverse all Accounts 
        The fastest way to traverse all Accounts, Projects Reviews, and Items is to get the entire tree
        
            tree_data = s.get_tree(withItems = True)
            
            for account in tree_data:
                for project in account['projects']:
                    if project['active'] == 1:
                        print project['name']
                        for review in project['reviews']:
                            for item in review['items']:
                                mediaid = item['id']
                                medianame = item['name']
                                print '\t %s:\t%s'%(mediaid, medianame)
